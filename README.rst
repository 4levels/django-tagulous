===============================

you all their normal power with a sprinkling of tagging syntactic sugar.

Features
========

* Easy to install - simple requirements, just drops into your site
* Autocomplete support built in - uses Select2, easy to customise
* Multiple independent tag fields on a single model
* Ability to share tags between tag fields
* Support for trees of nested tags for categorisation
* All the other features you'd expect a tagging library to have

**Please note**: this is an alpha version. That means that although it has been
used internally and tested extensively with Django 1.4 to 1.6 over several
years, and there are no known bugs for those version, the test suite does not
yet have 100% coverage, and official support for Django 1.7+ is still pending.
